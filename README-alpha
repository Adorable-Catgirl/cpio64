This is the GNU cpio package.

This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production use yet. If
you have dowloaded its sources from CVS, you will need to have the following
software to build it:

Package		Version (>=)
---------	------------
autoconf	2.54
automake	1.8
libtool		1.4.3
gettext	        0.13

To build the configuration suite, run

	autoreconf -f -i -s

Then, configure and build the package as usual.

Report bugs to <bug-cpio@gnu.org>

To retrieve the sources from CVS issue the following command:

CVS_RSH=ssh \
 cvs -d :ext:anoncvs@savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/cpio checkout cpio

Make sure SSHv2 is used.

This will give you read-only access. If you think you need write access,
contact the maintainer.
