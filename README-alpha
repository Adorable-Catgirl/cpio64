This is the GNU cpio package.

This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production use yet.
Please send comments and problem reports to <bug-cpio@gnu.org>.

If you have taken the sources from CVS you will need the following
packages (or later) to build GNU tar.  We don't make any extra effort
to accommodate older versions of these packages, so please make sure
that you have the latest stable version.

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Gettext <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>
- M4 <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
- Texinfo <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo>

Before building the package, run "bootstrap".  It obtains various
additional files from the CVS repository and the Translation Project
site and prepares the source directory for building.

When run without arguments, bootstrap will try to obtain gnulib and
paxutils files from their corresponding CVS repositories on Savannah
using anonymous SSH access.  Then, it will fetch the po files from tar
page at Translation Project, and, finally, it will start autoconfiguration
process.  Simply running it without arguments should do in most cases.
Several options allow to control the behavior of bootstrap:

 --gnulib-srcdir=DIRNAME      Specify the local directory where gnulib
                              sources reside. Use this if you already
                              have gnulib sources on your machine, and
                              do not want to waste your bandwidth dowloading
                              them again.

 --paxutils-srcdir=DIRNAME    Specify the local directory where paxutils
                              sources reside. Use this if you already
                              have paxutils sources on your machine, and
                              do not want to waste your bandwidth dowloading
                              them again.

 --cvs-auth=METHOD            Set the CVS access method used for downloading
                              gnulib files. METHOD is one of the keywords
                              accepted by cvs -d option (see info cvs
                              repository).

 --cvs-user=USERNAME          Set the CVS username to be used when accessing
                              the gnulib repository.

 --no-po                      Do not download po files.

Notice also that when using CVS authentication method "ext", bootstrap
will set the variable CVS_RSH to "ssh", unless it is already set to
some other value.

Then, configure and build the package as usual.
